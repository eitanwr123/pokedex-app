Perfect! Here's the prompt you can use to continue from exactly where we left off:
PROMPT TO RESUME: "I'm learning Dependency Injection step-by-step through hands-on implementation in my Pokedex project (backend/src). I want to write all the code myself with your guidance. What we've completed so far:
✅ Step 1 (Partial): Created IUserRepository.ts interface and refactored UserRepositoryImpl.ts to use NewUser parameter
Current status:
I'm about to create two more interfaces: IPokemonRepository.ts and IUserPokemonRepository.ts
After that, we'll move to Step 2: Constructor Injection
Learning approach I prefer: Teach me step-by-step through hands-on implementation. I want to write all the code myself. Guide me one step at a time, explain the concepts before each step, give me specific tasks to complete, then review my work before moving to the next step. Next task: I need to create IPokemonRepository.ts (based on PokemonRepositoryImpl.ts with 6 public methods) and IUserPokemonRepository.ts (based on userPokemonRepositorylmpl.ts with 2 methods). Please review my progress so far, then guide me through creating these two interfaces. After I complete them and you review, we'll move to Step 2: Constructor Injection."
